Title: The impact of size variation on predation
With my data the questions that could be explored for the final project are:
1. Did the size manipulation portion of this experiment (by raising flies at different temperatures) actually create flies of different sizes?
2. Is there a significant difference in trait sizes between individuals that survived to the end of the experiment as opposed to those that did not?
3. Is survival time influenced by the size of an individualsâ€™ specific trait? (ie. bigger wings vs. bigger legs)
** I have not collected any data of my own and the dataset I have been using for this class was part of a previous undergraduate project in my lab. While I will be looking at data similar to this with my own thesis, if this project is meant to help people move forward with their own data, the data that I have has already been analyzed.
