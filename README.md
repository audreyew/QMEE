Data
The dataset I will be using for this class is in the file "FO_TempPlasticitySelection_complete_April2018". This experiment involved rearing flies at three different temperatures to manipulate size. These flies were then exposed to two treatments, one being cages with predators and the other being cages without predators. The size of the flies and the number of days the flies survived in these treatments was recorded.
The dataset includes information on rearing temperature, treatment, cage number, how long the flies survived, the sex of the flies, and measurements for thorax, femur, tibia, and wing lengths. 

Biological Question:
Is natural selection (predation) influenced by individual fly size?
